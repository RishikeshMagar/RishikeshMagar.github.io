About Me

I am a Machine Learning Scientist at Deep Apple Therapeutics, working at the intersection of AI, drug discovery, and molecular design. My research focuses on generative models for small molecules and integrates insights from structural biology to advance structure-based drug design. Iâ€™m broadly interested in AI for Science, spanning applications in both materials science and computational biology. I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in the [Mechanical and AI Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/barati), where I developed machine learning techniques for materials property prediction.

When I'm not thinking about molecules, I enjoy reading history, following sports, or trying something new in the kitchen.

I enjoy collaborating with and mentoring students interested in applying machine learning to problems in AI for Science. Feel free to reach out if you're exploring research in this space.
